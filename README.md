### How to use Autopilot? <br>
Version 1.2.0+ has a feature: Autopilot, where you can input your destination, and the mod will take you there.<br>
**Step 1:** You will need to be flying in the air with Automatic Flight Mode enabled (see above).<br>
**Step 2:** Enter the command /setDestination <x> <y> <z> where x y z are your destination coordinates. <sup>(pls note that y coordinate is not counted; it doesn't matter)</sup><br>
**Step 3:** Enjoy!<br>
**Step 4:** The mod will automatically land if 'Perform Automatic Landing' is enabled in the Config. <br>
**Step 5:** To unset your current destination, use /removeDestination. To reuse your previously set destination, enter /setDestination without any further coordinates.
